        <h3 class='name'><strong>Places you must visit in Japan</strong>
        <ul>
            <li class='places'>Harmonica Yokocho</li>
            <p class='names'><em>This clutch of narrow alleys, a short walk from the north exit of JR Kichijoji station, is stuffed to the gills with hole-in-the wall eateries. A yellow sign marks the entrance to Harmonica Yokocho, which takes its name from the layout of the vendors, slotted cheek-to-jowl along the passageways like the reeds in a harmonica.</em></p>
            <li class='places'>Tokyo Skytree</li>
            <p class='names'><em>Topping off at 2,080 feet, the Tokyo Skytree is the tallest tower in the world. From the broadcast tower’s 360-degree observation decks, the whole city—its striking skyscrapers and neon intersections—looks like a magical circuit board. It’s a major tourist attraction and a ticket isn’t cheap, but even if you don’t pay to go inside, there’s no denying that the Tokyo Skytree brought the skyline to a whole new level. </em></p>
            <li class='places'>Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden</li>
            <p class='names'><em>Fancy a stroll in a Japanese garden? Get that and more at Shinjuku Gyoen. In addition to native, traditional gardens, the 144-acre park pockets French Formal and English Landscape gardens, all of which are worth the modest entrance fee. Landmarks are stunning and impossible to forget, like a Taiwan Pavilion perched along a serene pond.</em></p>
